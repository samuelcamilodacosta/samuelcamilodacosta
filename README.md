   # Hi, guys. Welcome to my GitHub.
  
  
    My name is Samuel Camilo da Costa.
    I'm a technology lover. 
    I always like to be learning new computer languages and solving problems.
    I hope you find what you want here.
    
    I have many hobbies.
    I like playing guitar, listen music, studying phylosophy, watch random documentaries, animes and series.
    I dream of knowing one day this immensity of lands that we call the world.
    
    Having the ability to learn is a blessing.
    Dedicating yourself to learning is your best gift.
    Sharing knowledge is the pinnacle of wisdom.

  # See you later, my dear friend.
