# Hi, guys. Welcome to my GitHub.
      
      My name is Samuel Camilo da Costa.
      I'm a technology lover. 
      I like to learn new computer languages and solve problems.
      I hope you find what you want here.
      
      I have many hobbies.
      I like read books, play guitar, listen music, study phylosophy, watch random documentaries, animes and series.
      I dream of knowing one day this immensity of lands that we call the world.
    
      Having the ability to learn is a blessing.
      Dedicating yourself to learning is your best gift.
      Sharing knowledge is the pinnacle of wisdom.
